    "CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. This project will guide you through some of that process."
